            <h1>No Water, No Chill: Hiking Pedraforca at 15</h1>
        
        <hr />

            <p>I was fifteen, at a summer camp in the Spanish Pyrenees, when someone casually pointed at a jagged, double-peaked mountain and said, “We’re hiking that as part of the camp.”</p>

            <p>That mountain was Pedraforca: a dramatic icon of Catalonia, all sharp edges and steep switchbacks. It looked intimidating. Even though I enjoy hiking, I was hoping it was joke. And severely underprepared.</p>

            <p>We set out with our backpacking packs, food, and water bottles that, in hindsight, were laughably small for the task ahead. The trail climbed quickly, heat rising off the rocks as we zigzagged toward the summit. It wasn’t long before we started rationing. Not long after that, everyone was out.</p>

            <p>There are no water sources on Pedraforca. None. Just endless sun, dry air, and a lot of kids pretending they weren’t on the verge of a collective meltdown.</p>

            <p>By the time we neared the top, I was only thinking of the last sips of water I had saved for the peak. As we did the final asscent, my fellow campers and I where on our hands and knees crawling up the hill. I would pass someone laying on the ground in exhaustion and tell them "Sort." and kept on going.</p>
        
            <p>The summit offered sweeping views of the Pyrenees, a sense of accomplishmnet, and letters from our parents, but also the grim realization that we still had to get down. And the descent?</p>

            <p>Absolute chaos.</p>

            <p>The backside of Pedraforca is a steep slope of loose rock, more sliding than hiking. At some point I skinned my leg. That’s when one camper, who was one of the stranger individuals there, pointed at my leg and said: “Do you want me to suck your cut?” I declined.</p>

            <p>He nodded, like that was a normal interaction, and we all continued trudging down the mountain, thirstier than ever and just slightly traumatized.</p>

            <p>We then reached a rest area for hikers with a sink! Everyone was so excited until we found out thee water wasn't potable.</p>

            <p>It was one of the most intense hikes of my teenage life, and somehow, one of the most unforgettable. Pedraforca humbled me, bonded our group through mutual suffering, and taught me an important truth: Bring more water than you think you’ll need. And maybe… fewer vampires.</p>
