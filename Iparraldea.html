            <h1>First Light: Seeing the Milky Way in Iparraldea</h1>

        <hr />

            <p>I was thirteen, standing in the middle of nowhere in the Iparraldea region of France: though “nowhere” isn’t quite right. There were three Buddhist monasteries tucked into the hills nearby, which to this day feels random.</p>

            <p>We were far from cities, and even farther from cell service. The air smelled like damp earth and pine, and the sky was waiting to show me something I didn’t know I needed.</p>

            <p>That night, I went out to my great aunt's backyard and there it was: the Milky Way, clear and endless. I’d never seen it before, I guess I had never really seen darkness like that before either. No streetlights. No headlights. Just the cosmos stretched across the sky like a rift in the night sky or an eye starring back at me. It felt like the universe was watching me.</p>

            <p>It hit me all at once, how small I was, how big everything else was, and how those two facts weren’t in conflict, but in harmony. I didn’t have the words for it then. I just knew something inside me had shifted.</p>   

            <p>Looking back, I think that was the moment I fell in love with stillness. With remote places. With places that make you feel a little lost in the best way.</p>

            <p>It was the kind of experience that doesn’t need photos. A man made device can never fully capture the essence of the cosmos. It lives best as a memory, woven into the quiet nights that followed and the way I still look at the stars, searching for that same hum of wonder.</p>
