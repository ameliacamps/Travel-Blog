        <h1>Cat Plaza: My Feline-Filled Stay in San Juan</h1>

      <hr />

        <p>When I booked my Airbnb in San Juan, Puerto Rico, I anticipated vibrant culture, historic charm, and ocean breezes. What I didn't expect was to find myself living next to what I affectionately dubbed "Cat Plaza."</p>
      
        <p>From the moment I arrived, I noticed cats lounging on sunlit steps, weaving through the cobblestone streets, and peering from balconies. These weren't just a few strays; they were a community of felines that seemed to have claimed this part of the city as their own.</p>
      
        <p>Each morning, I'd sip my coffee while watching the cats stretch and greet the day. In the evenings, they'd gather in the plaza, creating a serene, almost magical atmosphere. Their presence added a unique rhythm to the neighborhood, blending seamlessly with the historic ambiance of Old San Juan.</p>
      
        <p>Staying next to "Cat Plaza" became one of the highlights of my trip. It offered a glimpse into the harmonious coexistence between the residents of San Juan and their feline neighbors, adding depth and warmth to my travel experience.</p>
